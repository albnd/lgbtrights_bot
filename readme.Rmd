Bot tweeting the status of laws relating to LGBT rights in countries around the world. Written by Dave Hemprich-Bennett (hemprich.bennett@gmail.com) after being suggested by Alex Bond (want your email address here Alex?)

Currently the Bot will tweet information from a csv of data [downloaded from wikipedia on 01/06/18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory#LGBT-related_laws_by_country_or_territory), which Alex is due to tidy. It would be preferable to have the script pull information from the wikipedia page every time, to reflect the fact that laws will presumably change. I (Dave) exhausted my abilities and the time I currently have when trying to make this work, as my scraping skills are not the best. If anyone wants to contribute that, fork away!
